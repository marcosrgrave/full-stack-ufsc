## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `exercises`: the folder to maintain homework exercises
  - `lessons`: the folder to maintain class lessons notes
  - `projects`: the folder to maintain projects
  - `surveys`: the folder to maintain tests
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
